# LoginSystemOOP
  This is a program for making a login system with Object Oriented style.
  I did not make the code i just implemented the OOP style with my crappy php knowlegde.
  
## Warning
  if you searching for a log in system with php language, DO NOT USE this code.
  This code is the worst code you find, it's stupid and it's sucks.
  
  use the code from the video i listed in the credits, i got the code from learning
  from that video and change it to OOP.
